            <p>This was my first attempt at creating a website thanks to the Hack4Impact starterpack, overall was a great learning experience would recommend 10/10. The most difficult aspect for me was the CSS styling but I was happy that I created a cool hover feature over the navigation bar. Again thank you for this wonderful experience Hack4Impact and shout out to my interviewers.</p>

            <p>This is my second attempt to join Hack4Impact and this time I will be more focused on updating my previous starterpack, while implementing changes throughout bootcamp.  </p>
